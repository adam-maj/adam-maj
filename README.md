### Hi there 👋

I'm Adam, a problem solver and builder. I love working on my own projects/startup ideas and working with others on startups as well. 

## About Me
- 🧠 I have a huge variety of interests (ranging from neuroscience to quantum computing to much more) but I often find that coding is something that can be applied to every interest.
- 🚀 I like to explore new technologies frequently - right now I've worked a lot with full stack development and machine learning
- 🔨 I enjoy building new products, tutorials, and solutions that create value
